A WebRTC video chat streaming website is a real-time communication platform that allows users to connect and interact through live video and audio streams directly in their browsers, without the need for external plugins or software. It uses WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) technology to establish peer-to-peer connections for fast and secure media exchange.
